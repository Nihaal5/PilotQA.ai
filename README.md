# Auto-QA-as-a-Service (MVP)

> AI-powered, plug-and-play test automation platform for startups and developers.  
> Zero manual QA. Just instant, smart, scalable quality engineering.

## 🚀 Mission

We're building a platform that automates the *entire QA process* from user stories, API contracts, and UI designs — so startups can move faster, deploy safer, and scale without worrying about testing overhead.

## 🎯 Features (MVP Scope)

- 🔍 AI-generated test cases from user stories
- 🧪 Automated UI test execution using Selenium/Playwright
- 🌐 API test generation using Postman or Python + Requests
- 🛠 GitHub and JIRA integration for dev/QA sync
- 📊 Test result reporting with real-time dashboards
- 🤖 Future: Self-healing tests + flaky detection using GenAI

## 💡 Why This Matters

> Startups move fast — testing is often ignored until it's too late.  
> Our platform ensures that every release is tested, covered, and deploy-ready — *automatically.*

## 🏗️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React / Next.js (for future dashboard)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- **Automation**: Selenium + Playwright, Postman, RestAssured
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI API + LangChain + Python NLP
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Database**: Supabase / Firebase (for MVP)
- **Hosting**: Vercel + AWS Lambda

## 📅 Roadmap

- [ ] Phase 1: User Story → AI-generated Test Cases
- [ ] Phase 2: UI + API test execution with test result dashboard
- [ ] Phase 3: Slack + GitHub + JIRA integration
- [ ] Phase 4: Launch Private Beta
